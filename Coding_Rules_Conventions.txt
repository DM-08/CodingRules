** Variables **

* Naming Conventions
** Camel Case: For local variables and method parameters, use camelCase (e.g., myVariable, totalAmount).
** Pascal Case: For public fields, properties, and method names, use PascalCase (e.g., MyVariable, TotalAmount).
** Constants: Use all uppercase with underscores (e.g., MAX_COUNT).

* Descriptive Names
** Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables to indicate their purpose (e.g., userAge instead of age if it represents the age of a user).
** Avoid Single Letter Variables
** Except in loop counters or very small scopes, avoid using single-letter variable names like x or i.

* Use Appropriate Data Types
** Choose the most specific data type that fits your needs to optimize performance and memory usage.
I** nitialize Variables - Always initialize variables before use to avoid unexpected behavior or errors.
Scope

Limit the scope of variables as much as possible. Define variables in the smallest scope needed.
Constants
Define Constants

Use constants for values that do not change throughout the execution of the program (e.g., mathematical constants, configuration settings).
Naming Conventions

* Use all uppercase letters with underscores (e.g., MAX_SIZE, DEFAULT_TIMEOUT).

* Methods
** Use verbs and descriptive names (e.g., CalculateTotal, FetchUserData).
** Length -Keep methods short and focused. Each method should do one thing well.
Parameters

Limit the number of parameters. If a method requires too many parameters, consider using an object or a data structure.
Return Types

Use appropriate return types. Avoid void where a result is expected and use meaningful return values.
Classes
Naming

Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., CustomerManager, OrderProcessor).
Single Responsibility Principle

Ensure that each class has a single responsibility or purpose.
Encapsulation

Use access modifiers to control the visibility of class members (e.g., private, protected, public).
Comments
Use Comments Wisely

Write comments to explain "why" something is done, not "what" is done. The code itself should be clear enough to explain "what" is being done.
Update Comments

Keep comments up to date with changes in the code. Outdated comments can be misleading.
